### Inspiration
Many websites are not accesible, 86% of websites fail a basic accesibility test and 98% are not accesible to the minimum legal standard. With over one billion people being considered disabled this is a huge issue and one that needs to be addressed. We wanted to prevent users the headache and time wasting associated with viewing a site and learning it is inaccessible to you and therefore irrelevant to your needs.

### What it does
Ha11y is a **Google Chrome Extension** that can determine how **accessible** a website is to a user before they even open it. By taking inconsideration the user's disabilities, Ha11y is able to analyze each site and save the user both time and frustration. Note that Ha11y supports all of the disabilities under the Deque University's WCAG rule explanations. 
### Challenges that we faced
- Learning to build a chrome extension(we had not done it before).
- Following best software engineering practices while being prevented from using multiple functions for scripting within the Chrome Extension.
- Transitioning to consider Accessibility throughout the process rather than just at the end.
### Accomplishments that we are proud of
- Having the application prepared for release to the Chrome Web store.
- We had all disabilites that Deque(a leading accessibility company) focuses on included.
- We built a Node Express API and hosted it on AWS.
### What we learned 
- How to properly utilize branches, pull requests, issue trackers within Github.
- Explored Express integration with Docker.
- Learned about the Deque's Axe Core disability guidelines and WCAG rules.
- How to utilize AWS to host our own web services.
- Built our first Google Chrome Extension.  
### What's next for Ha11y?
- Implement caching and store results onto globally shared database.
- Incorperate additional customization options for users to have a more taliored experience.
- Allow users to locally host the API or run it from a public server. 
### Technologies Used
- [Node Express](https://expressjs.com/) API on a [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- HTML, CSS, and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) analyizer with Deque's [Axe Core](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- Built onto Google's [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
### Google Chrome's Extension Store Listing
After many hours of hard work, we are proud to announce that Ha11y is submitted onto Google Chrome's Extension Store!

# CornHacks 2022 - Ha11y

## Created by Colton Braccia, Tommy Braccia, Emma Hubka, Danny Tran

### Inspiration
Many websites are not accesible, 86% of websites fail a basic accesibility test and 98% are not accesible to the minimum legal standard. With over one billion people being considered disabled this is a huge issue and one that needs to be addressed. We wanted to prevent users the headache and time wasting associated with viewing a site and learning it is inaccessible to you and therefore irrelevant to your needs.

### What it does
Ha11y is a **Google Chrome Extension** that can determine how **accessible** a website is to a user before they even open it. By taking inconsideration the user's disabilities, Ha11y is able to analyze each site and save the user both time and frustration. Note that Ha11y supports all of the disabilities under the Deque University's WCAG rule explanations. 
### Challenges that we faced
- Learning to build a chrome extension(we had not done it before).
- Following best software engineering practices while being prevented from using multiple functions for scripting within the Chrome Extension.
- Transitioning to consider Accessibility throughout the process rather than just at the end.
### Accomplishments that we are proud of
- Having the application prepared for release to the Chrome Web store.
- We had all disabilites that Deque(a leading accessibility company) focuses on included.
- We built a Node Express API and hosted it on AWS.
### What we learned

### Inspiration
Many websites are not accesible, 86% of websites fail a basic accesibility test and 98% are not accesible to the minimum legal standard. With 26% of Americans being considered disabled this is a huge issue and one that needs to be addressed. Ha11y can rate a website based off a users disability and return a score for how accessible the given website will be for them. This saves a plethora of time and even more frusturation.
